        This is used in the PostProcessing, each scan can be evaluated in different
            wavelength regions and using different settings for the fit. The results
            in these different wavelength regions can then be compared for other purposes
            such as studying the radiative transfer...

        To save memory does	this not contain the column datas, only the names of the .txt files
            where they can be found.

        To reduce the number of times we need to read data from the evaluation-log files
            this also contains the calculated properties of the plume in the scan, such as the
            completeness, the angle of centre of mass of the plume etc.
